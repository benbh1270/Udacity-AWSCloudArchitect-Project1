Assuming: 24/7 Support, Proper Documentation, and Remote System Access
Environment: RDS MySQL DB configured in Multi-AZ and Multi-Region Read Replica

Minimum RTO Single AZ Failure: In the example of a failure in a single Availability Zone (AZ) in the primary region, failover is 
automatic and handled automatically by the AWS environment. For non-AUrora-type database instances, the failover takes between 1-2 minutes.  
Also, since AWS keeps the standby instance continuously up-to-date, the data loss will only be for the time that failover is happening.
So the minimum RTO for this event is 1 minute.

Minimum RTO Single Region Failure: In the example of a failure in the primary region and the existence of a Read Replica in the secondary region, the RTO can be
calculated from the a series of tasks/events that have to occur in order for the replica to be restored to be the primary instance due to the need to manually 
promote the the Read Replica.  The Read Replica can be promoted to be a standalone instance.  Example scenario:
    Time Elapsed                        Event 
    _________________________________________________________________________
    0:00                            Problem Occurs
    0:05                            Alerts Triggerd
    0:15                            24/7 Support Engaged
    0:25                            Support Processes Ticket/Consults Knowledge Base
    0:30                            Page Next Level Support
    0:40-1:30                       Next Level Support Online
    0:55-1:45                       Next Level Support Up To Speed
    1:15-2:05                       Root Cause Identified
    1:30-2:20                       Fix Implemented
    1:45-2:35                       Systems restored
So, the RTO is between 1:45 and 2:35.  This is dependent on the response time of the Next Level Support groups and the ability to quickly triage and identify
the root cause.  During this window, the DB will not be available and will not be accepting changes.

Minimum RPO Single AZ Failure: Since RPO is measured by the amount of time between the last good backup and the time of corruption, the RPO for this scenario would be 0,
as there is always a real-time backup in the second AZ.  There are edge cases that would necessitate restoring from the backup logs.  Those are granular to about 5
minutes, so the worst case RPO is 5 minutes.

Minimum RPO Single Region Failure: The RPO for a single region failure where there is a read replica available in another region, will again be very low
as the data is continuously replicated to the read replica.  So the data loss approaches 0, though the same edge cases apply, leaving an approximate RPO of 0 and worst 
case RPO of 5 minutes.
